Attention-Based Network for Classification and Electrode Selection of EEG signals. The network learns features from the EEG data by applying the self-attention mechanism on temporal, spectral, and spatial (electrodes) dimensions. The network and ML pipeline proposed in this work was implemented using **MNE** and **Keras**.


This repository contains the layers and model proposed for implementing the DAN. For more details about the network and the study please see the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746241).
